It was also imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003, which allowed estimates of its size and shape to be made – an irregular object roughly 3 x 5 km across.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, however, its faint image is drowned in a sea of stars, making observations with Earth-based telescopes extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nHowever, during its short-lived excursions to the inner Solar System, the warmth of the Sun causes ices on its surface to evaporate and jets of gas to blast dust grains into the surrounding space.\r\n\r\nIt is the target of ESA's Rosetta Mission.\r\n",
